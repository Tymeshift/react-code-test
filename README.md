# Tymeshift - React code test
Welcome to Tymeshift's react code testÂ ðŸ§ª

## Task description:

Implement small react application that will display "All locations" page.
Clicking on a specific location should display a modal with all the properties of that single location. Modal should be closable.

Locations on main "All locations" page are displayed with a card showing some of the location properties.
Every location card should also contain a section "Views:", displaying the real number next to it. Default starting value is 0.
Every time the user clicks on a location to display its properties, number of views should increase by 1.

All data is read-only and can be retrieved from [this API endpoint](https://6033c4d8843b15001793194e.mockapi.io/api/locations).

All application pages and components should follow the [provided design](https://www.sketch.com/s/e1647b30-8066-43dc-bbf3-5b81d5a01bb2).
